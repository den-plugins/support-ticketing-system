This engines plugin, Support Ticketing System, intends (as much as possible) to

	- implement addition codes (new feature) away from "core redmine codes", and
	- put all implementation codes (addition codes) away from the "core redmine codes",
	  where they are initially written.


Implementation codes, especially those "action" unit (as in new action)
in "core controllers" are perfect to be transferred here.


With this, we can manage both "core codes" and "addition codes" (thru engines plugin)
perfectly.


Disclaimer:
Prior to this attempt, solutions of extracting already implemented codes (which are additions)
in "core codes" are not yet all determine. Hence, this implies challenge once they are encountered.
